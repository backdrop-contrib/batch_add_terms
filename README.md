# Batch add terms

Provides a form for adding terms in batches from the vocabulary page. The form
accepts a list of one term per line. Each line can have one or more dashes
preceding the term to indicate the term is a child of the previous term in the
list.

There are options to skip duplicates of existing terms, and to choose the
language to assign each term in the list if multilingual support is enabled for
the vocabulary.
